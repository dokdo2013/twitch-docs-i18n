# Registering Your App

The first step to getting an access token is to register your application (this includes Twitch Extensions and chatbots). To register an application:

1. Log in to the developer console using your Twitch account. If you don’t have an account, select the Sign Up tab to create one.
  - When you sign up for an account, Twitch sends you an email to verify your account. Be sure to open the email and verify your account before proceeding.
  - You must also enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your account. To enable 2FA, navigate to Security and Privacy, and follow the steps for enabling 2FA under the Security section.
  - You’ll need to refresh your console for these changes to take effect.
2. Select the Applications tab on the developer console and then click Register Your Application.
3. Set Name to your application’s name. The name must be unique among all Twitch applications. Your app’s name is listed on the Connections page under Other Connections if your app requires user consent to access or modify the user’s resources.
4. Set OAuth Redirect URLs to the callback URL that your app uses for authorizations. After adding your redirect URL, click Add.
5. Select a Category (type of application) that your app belongs to.
6. Click the I’m not a robot checkbox.
7. Click Create.
8. Back in the Applications tab, locate your app under Developer Applications, and click Manage.
9. Note your Client ID, which you’ll use to get your access token and to set the Client-Id header in all API requests. Client IDs are considered public and can be embedded in a web page’s source.
10. Depending on the flow you use to get a token, you may need a client secret. For example, the Authorization Code Grant Flow requires a client secret. Click New Secret to generate a secret that you’ll use to get your access token. You must copy the secret and store it somewhere safe. Getting a new secret invalidates the previous secret, which might make your API requests fail until you update your app.

**IMPORTANT** Treat client secrets as you would your password. You must keep it confidential and never expose it to users, even in an obscured form.

**WARNING** Do not share client IDs among applications; each application must have its own client ID. Sharing client IDs among applications may result in the suspension of your application’s access to the Twitch API.
