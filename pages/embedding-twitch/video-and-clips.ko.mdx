# Embedding Video and Clips

You can embed live streams, video on demand (VOD), and clips in a website. Embedded video windows must be at least 400x300 pixels.

There are three types of VODs:

- Past broadcasts are created automatically from a live stream.
- Highlights can be created by broadcasters from past broadcasts.
- Uploads are external videos that are added to Twitch using the Video Uploads API or the Video Manager.

This guide discusses three techniques for embedding video and clips

- Embedding live streams and VODs in a [non-interactive frame](/embedding-twitch/video-and-clips#non-interactive-inline-frames-for-live-streams-and-vods).
- Embedding live streams and VODs in an [interactive iframe](/embedding-twitch/video-and-clips#interactive-frames-for-live-streams-and-vods).
- Embedding clips in a [non-interactive frame](/embedding-twitch/video-and-clips#non-interactive-iframes-for-clips).

For more information, see [Video on Demand](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/video-on-demand) and [How to Use Clips](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/how-to-use-clips).

## Non-Interactive Inline Frames for Live Streams and VODs

```html
<iframe
    src="https://player.twitch.tv/?<channel, video, or collection>&parent=streamernews.example.com"
    height="<height>"
    width="<width>"
    allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

Iframe Attributes

These attributes are defined in the IFrame element. The Twitch player can not set or modify them.

| Name	| Type	| Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `allowfullscreen` |	boolean |	A boolean attribute set by inclusion. In other words, including the attribute enables fullscreen viewing while excluding the attribute ensures fullscreen viewing is not allowed. |
| `height` |	number or string |	Height of the embedded window, in pixels. This can be expressed as a percentage, by passing a string like `100%`. Recommended minimum: 300 |
| `parent` |	string |	**(required)** Domain(s) that will be embedding Twitch. You must have one parent key for each domain your site uses. |
| `src` |	string |	The iframe `src` URL string should be https://player.twitch.tv/ with one of these required query string parameters:<br /><br /> `channel` – (string) Name of the channel, for a live stream.<br /><br />`video` – (string) Video ID (for past broadcasts, highlights, and video uploads). In this context (the video player), the video ID must have a “v” prefix.<br /><br />`collection` - (string) Collection ID, for a collection of videos.<br /><br />If both `video` and `collection` are specified, the specified collection starts playing from the specified video. If the video is not in the collection, `collection` is ignored and the specified video is played.<br /><br />If `channel` is specified along with `video` and/or `collection`, only `channel` is used. |
| `width` |	number or string |	Width of the embedded window, in pixels. This can be expressed as a percentage, by passing a string like `50%`. Recommended minimum: 400 |

Optional Query String Parameters on Iframe `src`

| **Name** |	**Type** |	**Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `autoplay` |	boolean |	If `true`, the video starts playing automatically, without the user clicking play. The exception is mobile devices, on which video cannot be played without user interaction. Default: `true`. |
| `muted` |	boolean |	Specifies whether the initial state of the video is muted. Default: `false`. |
| `time` |	1h2m3s |	Time in the video where playback starts. Specifies hours, minutes, and seconds. Default: `0h0m0s` (the start of the video). |

Video Metadata

Video information such as duration, view count, and associated Twitch channel is available via the [Get Videos](/twitch-api/reference/get-videos) API endpoint.

Examples

Using a channel name:

```html
<iframe
    src="https://player.twitch.tv/?channel=dallas&parent=streamernews.example.com&muted=true"
    height="720"
    width="1280"
    allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

Using a video ID:

```html
<iframe
    src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=v40464143&parent=streamernews.example.com&autoplay=false"
    height="720"
    width="1280"
    allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

Using a collection ID:

```html
<iframe
    src="https://player.twitch.tv/?collection=abcDeF1ghIJ2kL&parent=streamernews.example.com"
    height="720"
    width="1280"
    allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

## Non-Interactive IFrames for Clips

Embedding a Clip is different than embedding a live stream or VOD. The embedded Clips player uses a different set of query parameters and does not support the JavaScript interactive embed.

IFrame Prototype

</iframe>
```

Iframe Attributes

| `width` |	number or string |	Width of the embedded window, in pixels. This can be expressed as a percentage, by passing a string like `50%`. Recommended minimum: 400. |

Optional IFrame Query Parameters
